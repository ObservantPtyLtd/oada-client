# Observant's OpenLink API 

## Overview  
Observant's OpenLink API allows an Observant user to share their data with third-party applications through an interface that strives to be [Open Agriculture Data Alliance](http://openag.io/) compliant. The data exposed through the API is represented in accordance to the OADA documentation and the access to the API is restricted through the use of an [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/) authentication and authorisation mechanism. Once a user is authenticated they can provide authorisation to the third-party application to make use of their data. The data that a third-party application receives will be dependant on the data that the user chose to share through the Observant platform.
